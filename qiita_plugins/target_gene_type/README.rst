Target Gene Qiita type Plugin
=============================

Qiita (canonically pronounced *cheetah*) is an analysis environment for microbiome (and other "comparative -omics") datasets.

This package includes the Target Gene type plugin for Qiita. This defines the types 'SFF', 'FASTQ', 'FASTA', 'FASTA_Sanger', 'per_sample_FASTQ' and 'Demultiplexed' and makes them available in the Qiita installation.
