      <li><u>Description of Qiita.</u></li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Qiita is open-source microbial study management platform developed
            and maintained by the <a href="https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/">Knight
            Lab at the University of California, San Diego</a>, which is an
            organizational unit within the Regents of the University of
            California, a California constitutional public corporation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Qiita allows users to keep track of multiple studies with multiple
            "'omics" data and Qiita's main site provides database and compute
            resources to the global community, alleviating the technical
            burdens, such as familiarity with the command line or access to
            compute power, that are typically limiting for researchers
            studying microbial ecology. Qiita's platform allows for quick
            reanalysis of the datasets that have been deposited using the
            latests analytical technologies. This means that Qiita's
            internal datasets are living data that is periodically re-annotated
            according to current best practices.
